Task and Project Management

Descirption: A comprehensive platform where small business can manage project, assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress in real time.

1. Key Features:
   - Create, edit, and delete projects and tasks
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set deadlines and milestones
   - Task progress tracking (to Do, In progress, Completed)
   - Task prioritization (Low, Medium, High)
   - Notifications and reminders for due dates.

2. Special features:
   - Live Countdown
   - Points system to track employees performance

3. Advanced Collaborations Features:
   - Real-Time collaboration: Allow multiple users to edit a task or project      description simultaneously, similar to how Google Docs handles document      editing.
   - Built-in Video Conferencing: Integrate video conferencing features           directly within the tool for quick team meetings or discussions about a      specific task without needing external apps like Zoom or Teams.
   - Discussion Threads on Tasks: Embed discussion threads under each task,       enabling team members to have ongoing conversations directly linked to       the task for better context.
   - Whiteboard Feature: Add an interactive digital whiteboard for                brainstorming ideas and planning tasks collaboratively in real time.
  
5. Research on existing websites:
     Several project management tools exist, but most are designed for large      enterprises or come with a steep learning curve. Our tool will draw          inspiration from the following existing solutions while simplifying          them for small businesses:
     - Asana: Offers task management, project timelines, and tracking, but          its features can be overwhelming for smaller teams.
     - ClickUp: A highly customizable tool offering a variety of views              (lists, boards, Gantt charts) and features such as time tracking,            goal tracking, and document collaboration. While ClickUp is                  versatile, its rich feature set can be overwhelming for small                businesses with simpler needs.
